- 👋 Hi, I’m @FXWood350
- 👀 I’m interested in completely arbitrary things that happen to catch my eye. Jupyter Notebooks are really neat (more of a Labs person though-)
- 🌱 I’m currently "learning" python, and how to run/manage FreeBSD and Linux machines (mainly openSUSE) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything cool that isn't extremely important
- 📫 How to reach me: My current Discord Handle is Your Local Bog-Roll Seller#0641. But this changes from time to time, so email me at dodgy.offers12@gmail.com and pray you get noticed above all the spam.
